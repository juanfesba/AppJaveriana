 Project for my Mobile Dev. Class

**This is the project that I presented for my Mobile Dev. class.**

The university was looking to improve its App, and for that they wanted to see how our class would approach the development of an App that would catch the interest of the students by satisfying (mosft of) the necessities that this App could offer.

In order to do this, the University made a special **API REST Service** so that we could simulate for example how the App would obtain the current grades requested by a student from the servers of the University (it also offered the classes that a student was attending that semester, authentication services, some "personal" information, etc.).

**In the next image you can see for example how this App shows the user (the student that login) his schedule in the semester that he was attending at the moment (from the information it obtained from the API REST service)**. It also offered the option to tap on the class so that the student could see to what room was that class assigned.

**This app was developed with XAMARIN in Visual Code. It used Entity Framework (ORM) for the backend with an MVVM architecture.**

In the end this project was awarded as one of the best presented in the class.
